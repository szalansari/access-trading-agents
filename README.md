  Should you no longer require access or wish to depart from this community, kindly inform me, so that I may promptly adjust permissions and maintain the repository’s sanctity.

Embark on this journey at your own discretion, and may your trading acumen be as formidable as your resolve.

> **🛑 Disclaimer:** This repository is shared on a strictly need-to-know basis. Unauthorized dissemination of the contained materials is not only discouraged but may also have repercussions of a decidedly unrefined nature.
